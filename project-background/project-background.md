# Project Overview

>> describe, at a high level, a project on this topic that could satisfy the 100% level goals.

>> Potential project—the one you'd do for the 100% level—is described in the context of the project topic. 

# Project Value and Importance

>> value in everyday programming practice—an

>> you must base that description on existing work. How much? That will differ from project to project, but we'll try to quantify by saying "at least the equivalent of three CS conference research papers used suitably to support your description"

>> perhaps because of industrial or research impact

Ideas:

- find specific GitHub Issues of existing JS projects with `TypeError` or other runtime-related errors that could be prevented with TS
    - Q: What specific `Error`s does TS prevent?

# Industry Impact of Project

# Relation to Existing Context

>> relate your topic to its context (e.g., similar languages, analyses, semantic forms, or other projects and ideas). 
>> Project topic is well-situated in its context (i.e., similar languages, analyses, or language features, depending on your topic).




### Reminders of Specific Requirements


Novel technical aspects of the project topic are summarized using appropriate programming languages terminology

The technical aspects you describe should include any needed for the project proof-of-concept and plan, even if you're stopping at the 80% level.)
