### Reminders of Specific Requirements

Lay out the project topic you've selected, explain why it's important—perhaps because of industrial or research impact or value in everyday programming practice—and relate your topic to its context (e.g., similar languages, analyses, semantic forms, or other projects and ideas). 

describe, at a high level, a project on this topic that could satisfy the 100% level goals.

your own description of a topic and its value. However, you must base that description on existing work. How much? That will differ from project to project, but we'll try to quantify by saying "at least the equivalent of three CS conference research papers used suitably to support your description". 

Value/importance/impact of project topic is clear.

Overview of project topic is clear.

Project topic is well-situated in its context (i.e., similar languages, analyses, or language features, depending on your topic).

Novel technical aspects of the project topic are summarized using appropriate programming languages terminology

The technical aspects you describe should include any needed for the project proof-of-concept and plan, even if you're stopping at the 80% level.)

Potential project—the one you'd do for the 100% level—is described in the context of the project topic.
