# Proposal Notes (Work-in-progress)





# Things we've agreed upon:

- Writing something in TypeScript and then writing something in JavaScript to compare
- Web development

- Who's doing what?
    - Everybody is going to write some TS


## Background Research

Things to research and write about:

- Type safety of TS versus JS
    - Basic Types
    - Interfaces
    - Classes
    - Namespaces and Modules
    - Functions
    - Generics
- Mixins
- Type Inference
- Type Compatibility
- Writing Definition (.d.ts) Files
- how TS preserves runtime behavior of all JavaScript code

- How does TS align with current and future ECMAScript 6 proposals.

## Web app topic

Ideas:

1. People can't get into classes because they clash.
2. Quiz.
3. UBC course database access?

## Server-side 

- Are we going to have a database?
    - If not, we will need hardcoded data
- Ashley: currently doing something with Node.js and Express.js in another project, so probably can do the server-side stuff

## Client-side

- Who wants to do the UI layout with the HTML and CSS?
- jQuery

```html
    <form>...</form>
```

- possibly using Bootstrap for front-end framework

## Miscellaneous Comments

- Michelle: found lots of information about how TS is stronger/better than JS

## From Microsoft TypeScript Design Goals 

Question: Which of the following design goals do we want to follow/showcase?

1. Statically identify constructs that are likely to be errors.
2. Provide a structuring mechanism for larger pieces of code.
3. Impose no runtime overhead on emitted programs.
4. ~~Emit clean, idiomatic, recognizable JavaScript code. (Automatic)~~
5. ~~Produce a language that is composable and easy to reason about.~~
6. Align with current and future ECMAScript proposals. 
7. Preserve runtime behavior of all JavaScript code.
8. Avoid adding expression-level syntax.
9. Use a consistent, fully erasable, structural type system.
10. Be a cross-platform development tool.
11. Do not cause substantial breaking changes from TypeScript 1.0.
